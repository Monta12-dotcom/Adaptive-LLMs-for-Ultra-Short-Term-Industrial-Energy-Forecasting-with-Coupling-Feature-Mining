Multi-Energy Load Forecasting with LSTM/GRU
This project implements LSTM and GRU models for forecasting electricity, cooling, and heating loads in smart grids. The model predicts energy demand across multiple seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter) using historical data.

Features
LSTM and GRU-based forecasting for electricity, cooling, and heating loads.

MAPE and RMSE for performance evaluation.

Confusion matrix for classification performance.
